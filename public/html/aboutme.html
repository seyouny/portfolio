        <h4>Hello my name is Stacey! </h4>
        <br>
        I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine as a Chemistry major.
        I've always been interested in learning how to code and took several classes in college, however it wasn't until
        the pandemic hit that I realized this was what I truly wanted to do, and so I made a career switch. 
        Currently I'm interning at an environmental consulting company, and have been involved in several environmental
        organizations and programs. I'm hoping that I will learn enough to join a team that works with
        green technology and use my programming skills to help mitigate the effects of climate change.
        <br>
        <br>
        One recent hobby that I picked up recently is longboarding! It's my way of taking a break away from everything technical and complicated.
        I have been listening to so much music these days. I absolutely love small, indie artists, and discovering
        new sounds. My current favorite artists are Mac miller,
        Current Joys,
        Frank Ocean,
        Rex OC,
        Vansire,
        Mild High Club,
        Honne,
        Joji, and
        Daniel Caesar.
